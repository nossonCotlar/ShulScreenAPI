DAILY SUMMARY:Moses then taught the Jewish people that after they settle the Land of Israel and begin working the land, G-d has obligated them to bring a tenth of their produce and consume it in Jerusalem. This ensured that the people would regularly visit Jerusalem and renew their spiritual inspiration.

DAILY MESSAGE: Charity and Wealth

[Moses told the Jewish people,] “You must tithe all the produce of the seed that the field yields year by year.” Deuteronomy 14:22
This verse includes the instruction to donate a portion of our income to charity. The Talmudic sages pointed out that the similarity of the Hebrew words for “tithe” (ta’aseir) and “become rich” (titasheir) alludes to the fact that G-d rewards those who give charity with abundant wealth.
Furthermore, when we resolve to give charity beyond our means, G-d grants us the wealth that is required in order for us to give the charity we have resolved to donate.
