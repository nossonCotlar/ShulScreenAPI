PARSHA SUMMARY
The fourth section of the Book of Genesis continues the chronicle of Abraham. The name of this section (Vayeira, “He appeared”) is its first word, describing G-d’s revelation to Abraham after his circumcision. 

DAILY MESSAGE: Spiritual Transparency

G-d appeared to [Abraham]. Genesis 18:1
G-d’s self-revelation here to Abraham was on a fundamentally higher plane than His previous appearances to him. By circumcising himself in response to G-d’s command, Abraham became the first human being to surrender his selfhood entirely to G-d. Abraham could now experience G-d directly, without his ego getting in the way.  

This means that by accepting the Torah from G-d and committing ourselves to living according to His vision for us, we can remove all barriers between G-d and ourselves. This, in turn, enables G-d to reveal Himself in our lives in increasingly tangible ways.
