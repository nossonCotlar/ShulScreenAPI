DAILY CHUMASH SUMMARY:
Despite Abraham’s pleas, the wickedness of Sodom and its neighbors was so great that it could not be overlooked. The angels arrived at Lot’s house in order to rescue him from the impending destruction.

DAILY MESSAGE: Misguided Piety

[The angels said,] “?. . . because we are about to destroy this place, for the outcry before G d has increased, and G-d has sent us to destroy it.” Genesis 19:13
The wickedness of Sodom and its neighbors was a misguided overreaction to Noah’s Flood. The generation of the Flood had been wiped out chiefly because they practiced and condoned robbery – the forceful and unjust taking of one person’s property by another. The residents of Sodom, aware of this, declared private property rights absolute, outlawing charity and hospitality as unjust uses of another person’s possessions.

In their zeal, the people of Sodom did not realize that this opposite extreme was just as destructive as condoning robbery.
