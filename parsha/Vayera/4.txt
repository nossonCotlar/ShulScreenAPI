DAILY CHUMASH SUMMARY:
The angel sent to overthrow Sodom told Lot that he was about to destroy it, as if to say that he had the power to do so himself.

DAILY MESSAGE: Words that Matter

[The angel said to Lot,] “Hurry! Escape [to the nearby city], for I can do nothing until you arrive there. Genesis 19:22
Angels possess no intrinsic identity; they are simply personifications of G-d’s missions. Therefore, when the angels previously declared, “We are going to destroy the city,” they meant that G-d was going to destroy the city. 

Lot, however, misunderstood their words to mean that they did have independent powers outside of G-d’s. Therefore, the angels were compelled here to clearly state that their power was G-d-given.

When speaking with others, we too must take into account how they will interpret our words, ensuring that our intentions not be misinterpreted.
