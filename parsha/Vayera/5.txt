DAILY CHUMASH SUMMARY:
Abraham moved from Hebron to Philistia, and when he was 100 years old and his wife Sarah was 90, their son Isaac was born.  

DAILY MESSAGE: Feminine Power

G-d said to Abraham, “?. . . Whatever Sarah tells you, heed her voice.” Genesis 21:12
The more attuned a prophet is to the affairs of this world, the greater his or her degree of prophecy. Since Abraham was somewhat detached from worldly matters, he could not perceive Ishmael’s true negativity. Sarah, in contrast, was more involved in worldly matters, so she readily was able to perceive Ishmael’s evil. Her prophetic vision was therefore superior to Abraham’s.
Women’s more intense experience of physical life grants them a higher level of spiritual insight than that given to men.
