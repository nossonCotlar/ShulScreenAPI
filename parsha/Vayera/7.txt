DAILY CHUMASH SUMMARY:
Abraham’s greatest challenge came 37 years after his son Isaac was born. G-d commanded him to offer up Isaac..

DAILY MESSAGE: Tests

[G-d] said [to Abraham], “Please Take your son, your only one, the one you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah. Take him up there as an ascent-offering, on one of the mountains that I will designate to you.” Genesis 22:2
The primary aspect of this test was not only self-sacrifice it entailed but the challenge it posed to Abraham’s implicit faith in G-d: G-d had promised Abraham that Isaac would be the one to perpetuate his legacy. Yet Abraham unquestioningly carried out G-d’s command.

G-d tests us in order to bring our hidden soul-powers to the fore.
