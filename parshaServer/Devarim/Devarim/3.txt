Moses then reminded the Jewish people how they reacted to the scouts’ report after they had spied out the Land of Israel, accusing G-d of exhibiting ill will toward them.

G-d Only Loves

[Moses said to the Jewish people,] “You slandered G-d in your tents, saying ‘G-d took us out of Egypt out of His hatred of us.’?” Deuteronomy 1:27
Until the Final Redemption, when there will no longer be any obstacles impeding the full revelation of G-d’s goodness, opportunities will unfortunately remain to mistake G-d’s love for us for cruelty. Our challenge, until the Messianic Era, is to remain fully aware that G-d is at all times manifesting His love for us, even if it occasionally appears exactly the opposite. Remaining conscious of this love will inspire us to reciprocate it by fulfilling His will to our utmost ability. This, in turn, will eliminate the last remaining impediments to the Final Redemption.
