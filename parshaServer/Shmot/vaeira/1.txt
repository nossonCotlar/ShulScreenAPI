In the second section of the Book of Exodus, G d begins the process that will lead to the redemption of the Jews from Egyptian slavery. He first informs Moses that it is crucial that he and the Jewish people demonstrate the same faith in G d that the patriarchs did when He appeared (Va’eira in Hebrew) to them. After some additional preparations, G d then begins to strike the Egyptians with plagues.

At the end of the previous section, Moses was troubled by the seeming contradiction between his faith in G-d’s goodness and G-d’s apparent mistreatment of the Jewish people. G-d therefore told Moses: “You must learn from the patriarchs and matriarchs. They believed in Me unquestioningly, even though I made promises to them that I did not fulfill during their lifetimes.”

“Seeing” G-d"

G-d spoke to Moses, saying to him, “I am G-d. I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” Exodus 6:2-3
When it appears to us that something is wrong in the way G-d runs the world, G-d wants us to question Him. But at the same time, we must continue to believe absolutely in G-d’s reality and goodness.

From where can we draw the power to believe in G-d so thoroughly that we virtually see Him even in the darkest moments of exile? G-d answers this question by saying, “I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” The patriarchs and matriarchs possessed this unshakable faith, and we inherit it from them. If we nurture it properly, we, too, will “see” G-d even when His goodness is not readily apparent.

This faith enables us to live out the final moments of our exile yearning for its end – and demanding it! – while maximizing our use of its remaining moments. In this merit, we will hasten the Messianic Redemption.
